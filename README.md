# Consistify

Consistify is a smart, cross‑platform Flutter app that helps developers keep their LeetCode/Codeforces practice consistent. It monitors daily activity and, at a user‑chosen cutoff time, sends a precise reminder so you don’t unintentionally skip a day and lose momentum.

## About Consistify
Consistify helps you build and protect your daily problem‑solving habit. Set your own reminder time, get a timely nudge, and keep your streak alive.

## The Problem
- Missed days happen unintentionally. Developers get busy and forget to solve a problem, breaking streaks they worked hard to build.
- Streak loss kills motivation. One lapse reduces streaks and breaks the habit loop that drives improvement.
- Skill erosion over time. Irregular practice slows progress and weakens problem‑solving fluency.
- No timely nudge. People don’t get reminders at the right time for them. Without a reminder set to their own schedule, they can easily miss the time to solve a problem.

## The Solution
Consistify tracks whether you solved a problem today and pairs it with a user‑defined notification time (set during registration or in Profile). If you haven’t solved anything by that time, the app sends a clear, actionable reminder to protect your streak and keep your skills sharp.

### How it works
- Monitors whether you solved at least one problem each day.
- Lets you pick your personal reminder time (e.g., 18:00).
- If no activity is detected by the cutoff, it triggers a reminder.

Example reminder text:
- “It’s 18:00 — solve one problem now to keep your streak alive.”
- “Don’t lose today! One quick solve preserves your consistency.”

## Features
